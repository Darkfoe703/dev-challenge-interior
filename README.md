Hi everybody!
This is another challenge for "devChallenges". It wasn't difficult, but it had to start somewhere.
I need improve my javascript skills, for example to make a responsive menu in better way... This is a solution but it can be improved.
You can see the result in this [link](https://darkfoe703.github.io/dev-challenge-interior/solution.html).

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

To do this, I used the PicoCSS framework. It's very simple and clean, with few predefined components, and I like it :)
- [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/)
